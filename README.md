# About Me

My name is Patrick and I'm working right now as a data platform engineer but love coding in my spare time. 

I recently graduated from WPI with a Bachelors in Computer Science and plan on pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science. 

Here's some of my main projects that I work on. Feel free to reach out for collaboration, questions, or just to say hi! ðŸš€
